# DoorOS Open-source Project

Welcome to the DoorOS Open-source project! DoorOS is a free and open-source graphical user interface (GUI) operating system, serving as a powerful and versatile alternative to Windows. Written in C/C++, DoorOS is designed to cater to a broad audience, from everyday users to enterprises requiring a robust and customizable OS solution.

## Features

- **32/64-bit Support**: Compatible with both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures, ensuring a wide range of device compatibility.
- **GUI Interface**: A user-friendly and visually appealing graphical user interface that simplifies navigation and usage.
- **Open Source**: Licensed under the GNU General Public License v2.0-only, DoorOS encourages community involvement in its development and improvement.
- **Enterprise Edition**: While DoorOS is free for personal use, we offer a paid Enterprise Edition designed for businesses, featuring additional tools and support. See [DoorOS Enterprise](README-Enterprise.md) for more information.

## Getting Started

To build DoorOS from source, you'll need:

- Docker

### Building DoorOS

   git clone https://github.com/DoorOS-Project/DoorOS.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd DoorOS
   ```
3. Install `os-build-utility`:
   ```bash
   wget https://github.com/DoorOS-Project/os-build-utility/releases/latest/download/os-build-utility-linux -O os-build-utility && chmod +x os-build-utility # *nix
   curl -L https://github.com/DoorOS-Project/os-build-utility/releases/latest/download/os-build-utility-windows.exe -o os-build-utility.exe # Windows
   ```
4. Build the OS:
   ```bash
   ./os-build-utility --build # *nix
   os-build-utility.exe --build # Windows
   ```

### Running DoorOS

After building DoorOS, you can run it on an emulator like QEMU using this command:
